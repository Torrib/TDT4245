Branches are used to separate the project when different people are working on multiple things at once.
You create a branch, do all your work on that branch, then that branch is merged into master again.

- `git checkout -b [branchname]` - Creates a new branch
- `git checkout [branch]` - Changes the active branch that you are working on to [branch]
- `git branch` - Lists all local branches on the project
